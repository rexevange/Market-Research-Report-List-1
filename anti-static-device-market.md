<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Current</li><li>Alternating Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static device market includes two main types: Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC). DC anti-static devices operate with a constant flow of electric charge in one direction, providing a steady neutralization of static electricity. On the other hand, AC anti-static devices function by periodically reversing the flow of electric charge, neutralizing static electricity through a continuous cycle of positive and negative charges. Both types serve the purpose of preventing damage caused by static electricity, but differ in their approach to neutralization.</p></p>

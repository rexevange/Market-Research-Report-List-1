<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Flares Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elevated Torch</li><li>Surface Torch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Process flares are used in industrial facilities to safely burn off excess gases. There are two main market types in process flares: Elevated Torch and Surface Torch. An Elevated Torch flare is mounted on a tower or a structure at a higher elevation, allowing better visibility and reducing noise levels. On the other hand, a Surface Torch flare is installed at ground level and is mainly used when space constraints or other considerations make it impractical to have an elevated flare. Both types serve the same purpose of safely disposing of excess gases.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BOPP Synthetic Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Synthetic Paper</li><li>Uncoated Synthetic Paper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>BOPP Synthetic Paper is a versatile material commonly used in various industries. It can be categorized into two main types: Coated Synthetic Paper and Uncoated Synthetic Paper. Coated Synthetic Paper is treated with a thin layer of coating, which enhances its durability, smoothness, and printing capabilities. This type is commonly utilized for applications that require high-quality prints, such as packaging, labels, and signage. On the other hand, Uncoated Synthetic Paper does not have any additional coating, making it more cost-effective. It is frequently used for applications like book covers, maps, and posters. Both types offer excellent tear resistance, water resistance, and longevity.</p></p>

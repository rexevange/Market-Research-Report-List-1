<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Exchanger Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seamless Tube</li><li>Welded Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat exchanger tubes market consists of two primary types: seamless tubes and welded tubes. Seamless tubes are produced without any welding seams, providing a smoother internal surface. They are generally more expensive and offer better resistance to corrosion and higher pressure applications. On the other hand, welded tubes are manufactured by joining two or more pieces of metal together using welding techniques, resulting in cost-effective solutions. While they may have slightly reduced corrosion resistance, they are suitable for lower pressure applications.</p></p>

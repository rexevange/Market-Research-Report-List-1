<p><h1>Over-the-horizon Radar Market Offer Valuable Insights into Market Size, Market Share, Market Trends, and Projections Spanning from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Over-the-horizon Radar Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) is a type of radar system that can detect and track objects beyond the horizon, typically over long ranges. Unlike traditional radar systems that rely on line-of-sight, OTHR bounces radio waves off the Earth's ionosphere to extend their range and overcome the curvature of the Earth. This enables the detection of targets such as ships, aircraft, and missiles that are beyond the reach of conventional radars.</p><p>The Over-the-horizon Radar Market is expected to exhibit significant growth in the coming years. The increasing demand for advanced surveillance and security systems, particularly in maritime and border control applications, is a major driving factor for the market. OTHR systems provide long-range detection capabilities, making them ideal for monitoring large areas, detecting intrusions, and supporting military operations.</p><p>Additionally, technological advancements in radar technology, such as the integration of OTHR with artificial intelligence (AI), are further fueling market growth. AI-enabled OTHR systems offer enhanced target identification, classification, and tracking capabilities, improving the situational awareness of operators.</p><p>Moreover, the rising territorial disputes and geopolitical tensions among various countries have led to increased investments in defense and security infrastructure. This, in turn, is driving the adoption of OTHR systems by military organizations worldwide.</p><p>Furthermore, continuous research and development activities by key market players are leading to the introduction of more efficient and advanced OTHR systems, supporting market growth. </p><p>Overall, the Over-the-horizon Radar Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period, driven by the increasing demand for advanced surveillance and security solutions, technological advancements, and rising defense spending.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Powered Truck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Truck</li><li>LNG Truck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two types of natural gas-powered trucks available in the market: CNG trucks and LNG trucks. CNG trucks, or compressed natural gas trucks, use natural gas that is compressed and stored onboard the vehicle in gaseous form. LNG trucks, or liquefied natural gas trucks, use natural gas that has been cooled and converted into a liquid for storage. Both types offer environmental benefits compared to diesel trucks, as natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases. However, CNG trucks are more common for shorter-haul applications, while LNG trucks are typically used for long-haul transportation.</p></p>

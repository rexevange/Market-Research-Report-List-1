<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical-grade Nitroglycerin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Nitroglycerin</li><li>Diluted Nitroglycerin</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pharmaceutical-grade Nitroglycerin is classified into two market types: pure nitroglycerin and diluted nitroglycerin. Pure nitroglycerin refers to the product in its undiluted form, containing a higher concentration of the active ingredient. It is commonly used in the manufacturing of medicines like tablets and sprays. Diluted nitroglycerin, on the other hand, is a less concentrated form of the medication. It is typically used in the preparation of compounded formulations and as a raw material for further processing in pharmaceutical industries.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical-grade Nitroglycerin Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitroglycerin Spray</li><li>Nitroglycerin Patch</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pharmaceutical-grade nitroglycerin finds its application in various market segments. Nitroglycerin spray is primarily used for relieving chest pain caused by angina. It is administered under the tongue to ensure rapid absorption into the bloodstream. Nitroglycerin patches, on the other hand, are transdermal patches that provide a slow release of the medication over a prolonged period. These patches are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of angina. There are other markets where pharmaceutical-grade nitroglycerin is utilized, including the production of nitroglycerin-infused ointments and the manufacturing of explosives under strict safety regulations.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Imaging Scopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Thermal imaging scopes are used to detect heat signatures in dark or obscured environments. There are two main types of thermal imaging scopes: un-cooled and cryogenically cooled. Un-cooled scopes are more commonly found and are cheaper as they do not require any cooling technology. They work by using microbolometers to detect infrared radiation. On the other hand, cryogenically cooled scopes are more expensive and use a cooling mechanism to enhance their sensitivity and image quality. This cooling process involves using liquid nitrogen or other cryogenic substances to cool the detectors.</p></p>

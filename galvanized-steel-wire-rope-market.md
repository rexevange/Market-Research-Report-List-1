<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Wire Rope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro-Galvanizing Steel Wire Rope</li><li>Hot-Dip Galvanized Steel Wire Rope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel wire rope refers to a type of steel wire rope that has been coated with a layer of zinc to enhance its corrosion resistance. There are two main types of galvanizing processes used: electro-galvanizing and hot-dip galvanizing. Electro-galvanizing involves immersing the steel wire rope in an electrolyte solution and applying an electric current to deposit a thin layer of zinc on its surface. Hot-dip galvanizing, on the other hand, involves immersing the steel wire rope in molten zinc to create a thicker and more durable zinc coating.</p></p>

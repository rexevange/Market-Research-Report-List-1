<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biologics in Spine Surgery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Graft</li><li>Bone Graft Substitute</li><li>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biologics in spine surgery refer to medical products derived from living sources, including bone grafts, bone graft substitutes, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and other biologically relevant materials. Bone grafts are real bone tissue transplants used to promote bone growth and fusion. Bone graft substitutes, on the other hand, are synthetic or bioengineered materials that function similar to natural bone grafts. Platelet-rich plasma is a concentration of platelets in plasma, which contains growth factors to stimulate tissue healing. The "other" market includes various biologics such as stem cell therapy and growth factors for spinal regeneration.</p></p>

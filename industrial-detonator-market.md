<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Detonator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prompt Detonator</li><li>Delay Detonator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial detonator market consists of two main types: prompt detonators and delay detonators. Prompt detonators are designed to provide immediate explosive force upon activation, making them suitable for applications where precise timing is not required. On the other hand, delay detonators are engineered to introduce a time delay before detonation, allowing for more controlled and timed explosions. Both types play significant roles in industries such as mining, quarrying, construction, and petroleum, where explosive substances are used for various purposes.</p></p>

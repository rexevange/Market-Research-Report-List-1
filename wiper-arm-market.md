<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wiper Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermittent Type</li><li>Automatic Induction Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wiper arm market includes two main types: intermittent type and automatic induction type. Intermittent wiper arms are designed to move the wiper blades intermittently, meaning they pause between sweeps. This type offers different modes for adjusting the speed and frequency of the wiper movement according to weather conditions. On the other hand, automatic induction wiper arms use sensors to detect rain on the windshield and automatically activate the wiper blades. This type ensures that the wipers start working as soon as rain is detected, providing convenience and safety for drivers.</p></p>

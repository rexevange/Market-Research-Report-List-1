<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel-Speed Based(Indirect TPMS)</li><li>Pressure-Sensor Based(Direct TPMS)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules (TPMCM) market can be categorized into two types: Wheel-Speed Based (Indirect TPMS) and Pressure-Sensor Based (Direct TPMS). In Wheel-Speed Based TPMS, the system calculates tire pressure indirectly by measuring the rotational speed of each wheel. It relies on the assumption that under-inflated tires have a different rotational speed. On the other hand, Pressure-Sensor Based TPMS directly measures the air pressure in each tire using sensors. It provides accurate and real-time pressure readings, allowing for more precise monitoring and maintenance of tire pressure.</p></p>

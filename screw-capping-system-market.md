<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Screw Capping System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic</li><li>Fully Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The screw capping system market is categorized into two types: semi-automatic and fully automatic. In the semi-automatic market, capping machines require human intervention to place the caps on the bottles before the system applies the screwing action. On the other hand, the fully automatic market involves capping machines that autonomously place and tighten the caps without human involvement. Both types play a vital role in industries that require efficient and precise sealing of bottles, jars, or containers, but the level of automation differs between the two.</p></p>

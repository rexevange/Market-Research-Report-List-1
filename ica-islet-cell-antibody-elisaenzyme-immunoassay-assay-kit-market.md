<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICA (Islet Cell Antibody) ELISA(Enzyme immunoassay) Assay Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Competition ELISA</li><li>Sandwich ELISA</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ICA (Islet Cell Antibody) ELISA Assay Kit market consists of two main types of assays: Competition ELISA and Sandwich ELISA. Competition ELISA measures the amount of target protein by using a predetermined amount of labeled antigen and a sample containing unlabeled antigen. The more unlabeled antigen present, the less labeled antigen will bind, indicating the presence of target protein. Sandwich ELISA, on the other hand, detects the target protein by using a capture antibody to immobilize it, followed by a detection antibody that binds to the captured protein, creating a sandwich-like structure for detection.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Friction Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake</li><li>Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The metallic friction pads market includes two main types: brake pads and clutch pads. Brake pads are widely used in automotive vehicles and provide resistance to slow down or stop the vehicle when the brakes are applied. Clutch pads, on the other hand, are used in the clutch system of vehicles to engage or disengage the power transmission between the engine and the wheels. Both brake pads and clutch pads are made of metallic materials, such as iron, steel, or copper, which offer high friction and heat resistance properties.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Metallic Friction Pads Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Original Equipment</li><li>Aftersales</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The metallic friction pads market is used in two main applications. The first application is in the original equipment, which refers to the use of metallic friction pads by vehicle manufacturers during the production of vehicles. These pads are installed in the vehicles before they are sold to the customers. The second application is in the aftermarket, which means that metallic friction pads are sold separately as replacement parts for vehicles that already have worn-out or damaged brake pads. These aftermarket pads are purchased by customers for maintenance or repair purposes.</p></p>

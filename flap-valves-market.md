<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flap Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flap Valves are used to prevent backflow in pipes and channels. Type I flap valves have a hinged disc that allows flow in one direction and closes when reverse flow occurs. These valves are typically used in sewage systems and drainage networks. On the other hand, Type II flap valves are non-return valves that use a flexible material to cover the channel opening. They are commonly utilized in water treatment plants and coastal areas to protect against tidal or storm surge flooding. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of fluid transportation systems.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Resin Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dimethacrylates</li><li>Organically Modified Ceramics (OrMoCers)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dental resin composite market consists of various types, including dimethacrylates and organically modified ceramics (OrMoCers). Dimethacrylates are synthetic resins made from the reaction between a dimethacrylate monomer and a polymerizable diluent. They are commonly used in dental restorations due to their excellent bonding properties and durability. On the other hand, organically modified ceramics (OrMoCers) are hybrid materials that combine the properties of ceramics and organic polymers. They are used for aesthetic dental restorations as they provide strength, durability, and natural-looking results.</p></p>

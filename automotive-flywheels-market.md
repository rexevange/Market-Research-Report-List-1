<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Flywheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Freewheel</li><li>Multilevel Flywheel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive flywheels market consists of two types: single freewheel and multilevel flywheel. A single freewheel flywheel is a mechanism that allows the engine to keep spinning while the transmission is in neutral, enabling smoother gear changes. On the other hand, multilevel flywheels use multiple flywheels with different rotational speeds to efficiently store and release energy. These flywheels are commonly used in hybrid electric vehicles, where they help in regenerative braking and provide additional power for acceleration.</p></p>

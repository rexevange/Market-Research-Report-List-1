<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emissions Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emissions Analysers are categorized into two types - In-situ and Extractive. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentrations directly at the source, without the need for sample collection. They are suitable for continuous monitoring and provide real-time results. On the other hand, Extractive analyzers involve extracting a gas sample from the emission source and then analyzing it. This method is commonly used when direct in-situ measurement is not feasible or when more accurate and detailed analysis is required. Both types play a crucial role in monitoring and controlling emissions in various industries.</p></p>

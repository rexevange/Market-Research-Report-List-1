<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Daytime Running Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-voltage</li><li>Parking light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive daytime running light market can be categorized into two types: Full-voltage and Parking light. Full-voltage daytime running lights are designed to operate at the same voltage as the vehicle's main lighting system, providing enhanced visibility during daylight hours. On the other hand, parking lights serve a dual purpose by acting as both daytime running lights and parking lights. They emit a lower level of illumination compared to full-voltage lights when the vehicle is parked or stationary, and automatically switch to full intensity while the vehicle is in motion during the daytime.</p></p>

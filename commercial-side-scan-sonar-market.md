<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Side Scan Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Multi-beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial side scan sonar market can be classified into two types: single-beam and multi-beam. Single-beam sonar systems utilize a single sound wave to create an image of the seafloor, producing a relatively low-resolution image. In contrast, multi-beam sonar systems emit multiple sound waves simultaneously, enabling higher resolution and faster mapping of larger areas. Multi-beam sonar is preferred for its enhanced accuracy and efficiency in conducting detailed underwater surveys and seafloor mapping, making it more suitable for commercial applications.</p></p>

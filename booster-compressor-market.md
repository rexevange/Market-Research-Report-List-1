<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Booster Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled</li><li>Water-cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The booster compressor market is classified into air-cooled and water-cooled types based on the cooling method used to dissipate heat generated during compression. In air-cooled compressors, the heat is transferred to the surrounding air using a fan, while in water-cooled compressors, the heat is transferred to a water source via a heat exchanger. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages. Air-cooled compressors are simpler and more cost-effective, but they may require additional maintenance due to higher operating temperatures. Water-cooled compressors provide better cooling efficiency but require access to a water source for operation.</p></p>
